### Spark Safe - A wildfire vulnerability indicator 
California has more wildfires than any other U.S. state. In 2020, California saw one of the worst wildfire seasons in recorded history, and climate change could lead to even more wildfire destruction in the future (Yan et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2020). To support Cal Fire and the state of California in their important work protecting California from fire, we have developed a mobile application called SparkSafe. Using the SparkSafe app, homeowners in 13 Northern California counties can enter their address and immediately learn their wildfire risk score. Those in high risk areas are prompted to submit an inspection through the app by taking photographs with their smart phones. All users will also have access to educational content about wildfire prevention and safety through the app.
